					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						By accessing or using Accountability Bet ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. Description of Service</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						Accountability Bet is a goal-tracking application that allows users to create commitment contracts ("bets") with accountability partners. Users can:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mt-2">
						<li>Create bets with specific goals, frequencies, and financial stakes</li>
						<li>Upload photo proof of goal completion</li>
						<li>Have proof validated by accountability partners</li>
						<li>Track IOUs (amounts owed) when commitments are not met</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">3. Eligibility</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into binding agreements.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">4. User Accounts</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						You are responsible for:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mt-2">
						<li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials</li>
						<li>All activities that occur under your account</li>
						<li>Providing accurate and complete information</li>
						<li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized access</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">5. The Nature of Bets</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						<strong>Important:</strong> Bets created on the Service are personal commitment contracts between you and your accountability partner. The Service facilitates tracking and communication but does not:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mt-2">
						<li>Hold, transfer, or process any money on your behalf</li>
						<li>Enforce payment of IOUs</li>
						<li>Guarantee that your partner will pay what they owe</li>
						<li>Act as a gambling or betting platform</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
						Settlement of IOUs is entirely between you and your accountability partner, outside of the Service (e.g., via bank transfer, Twint, cash).
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">6. Acceptable Use</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						You agree not to:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mt-2">
						<li>Use the Service for illegal purposes</li>
						<li>Upload inappropriate, offensive, or illegal content</li>
						<li>Harass, abuse, or harm other users</li>
						<li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service</li>
						<li>Use the Service to create fraudulent bets</li>
						<li>Impersonate another person or entity</li>
						<li>Interfere with the proper functioning of the Service</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">7. User Content</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						You retain ownership of content you upload (photos, messages, etc.). By uploading content, you grant us a limited license to store, display, and transmit that content as necessary to provide the Service.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
						You are solely responsible for the content you upload and must ensure you have the right to share it.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">8. Proof Validation</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						The proof validation system works as follows:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mt-2">
						<li>You upload photo proof of completing your goal</li>
						<li>Your accountability partner reviews and approves or rejects the proof</li>
						<li>If your partner does not respond within 24 hours, the proof is automatically approved</li>
						<li>Rejected proofs may be resubmitted once</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
						We do not verify the accuracy of proofs. Validation is entirely at the discretion of accountability partners.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">9. Charity Donations</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
						When you choose to donate to charity instead of paying your partner, the donation is processed directly between you and the charity. We may provide links or integration with charity payment systems but do not handle donation funds.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">10. Disclaimers</h2>
